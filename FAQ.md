## ü§î General Questions

### What is Goose Slackbot?

Goose Slackbot is an AI-powered data assistant that allows you to query your data warehouse using natural language directly in Slack. It uses Goose Query Expert to understand your questions and generate SQL queries automatically.

### How does it work?

1. You ask a question in natural language (e.g., "What was our revenue last month?")
2. Goose Query Expert analyzes your question and your data schema
3. It generates an optimized SQL query
4. The query is executed against your data warehouse (Snowflake)
5. Results are formatted and displayed in Slack

### Is it secure?

Yes! The bot includes:
- Enterprise authentication (LDAP integration)
- Role-based access control
- Complete audit logging
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for detailed security information.

### What data sources are supported?

Currently supported:
- ‚úÖ Snowflake (primary)
- üîÑ BigQuery (coming soon)
- üîÑ Redshift (coming soon)
- üîÑ PostgreSQL (coming soon)

### How much does it cost?

The Goose Slackbot itself is open source and free. However, you'll need:
- Snowflake account (charges apply for query execution)
- Infrastructure to host the bot (cloud hosting costs)
- Slack workspace (free or paid plan)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### How do I access the bot?

1. Find `@goose-bot` in your Slack workspace
2. Send it a direct message or mention it in a channel
3. You can also use the `/goose-query` slash command

### Do I need special permissions?

Yes, you need the `query_execute` permission. Contact your admin if you don't have access:
```
@admin I need access to the Goose Slackbot for data queries
```

### How do I know if I have access?

Try sending a simple message to the bot:
```
@goose-bot hello
```

If you get a response, you have access. If you get a permission error, contact your admin.

### What's the best way to learn?

1. Start with simple questions: "Show me a sample of sales data"
2. Look at the [USER_MANUAL.md](USER_MANUAL.md) for examples
3. Learn from colleagues' queries in shared channels
4. Experiment with different question formats

## üí¨ Using the Bot

### How do I ask a question?

You can interact with the bot in three ways:

**1. Direct Message:**
```
What was our revenue last month?
```

**2. Channel Mention:**
```
@goose-bot Show me top 10 customers by sales
```

**3. Slash Command:**
```
/goose-query How many new users signed up this week?
```

### What kind of questions can I ask?

You can ask about:
- **Metrics**: "What was our revenue last month?"
- **Trends**: "Show me daily sales for the past 30 days"
- **Comparisons**: "Compare Q3 vs Q4 revenue"
- **Top/Bottom**: "Who are our top 10 customers?"
- **Aggregations**: "What's the average order value?"
- **Filters**: "Show me sales in California"

### Can I ask follow-up questions?

Yes! Ask follow-up questions in the same thread:
```
Initial: "What was our revenue last month?"
Follow-up: "How does that compare to the previous month?"
Follow-up: "Which products contributed most?"
```

### How specific should my questions be?

More specific = better results:

**Good:**
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Bot isn't responding

**Check:**

3. Are you in a supported channel?
4. Do you have permissions?

**Try:**
```
@goose-bot hello
```

If no response, contact your admin.

### "Permission denied" error

**Cause**: You don't have the required permissions

**Solution**:
1. Contact your admin
2. Request `query_execute` permission
3. Explain what you need access for

### "No data found" error

**Possible causes:**
- Date range too narrow
- Filters too restrictive
- Data doesn't exist
- Typo in question

**Try:**
- Broader date range
- Fewer filters
- Verify data availability
- Check spelling

### Query is taking too long

**If query is still running:**
- Wait for progress updates
- Check if it's a complex query
- Consider making it more specific

**If query times out:**
- Reduce date range
- Be more specific
- Add filters to reduce data volume
- Contact admin about timeout limits

### Results don't match expectations

**Steps:**
1. Review the generated SQL
2. Check your question for ambiguity
3. Verify data freshness
4. Compare with known results
5. Ask for clarification from data team

### Can't download CSV file

**Check:**
- File size limits in Slack
- Your download permissions
- Browser settings
- Network connection

**Alternative:**
- Ask for results to be emailed
- Request smaller date range
- Use query history to re-run
